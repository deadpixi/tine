add visual-block mode
Improve screen redisplay efficiency
eventually, remove the ncurses dependency
make sure the error messages and prompts match those of ED
clean up redisplay/statuscb/resize/etc...we have a lot of duplicated code there
add client-server multi-window support
add basic syntax highlighting
we should probably better map some of the added commands
we should figure out how to better split things between EDITORs and VIEWS
   - almost everything should be in the VIEW...basicaly everything except bookmarks
make the highlighting system more generic
handle SIGPIPE
make sure if we browse back in history, we keep the cursor at the end
   - make sure that even if we browse back in history, we start on an empty line
     next time
